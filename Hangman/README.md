# Overview

This program was made with the intention of practicing the C++ language, particularly by making a game
with it. This is a console game of Hangman that can allow multiple people to play the game. Using the Words
class to handle both the given phrase and placeholder, and using the Game class to handle game logic, it can
allow for single words or full phrases, a basic level of error handling to ensure the user doesn't insert
anything random, as well as the ability to start a new game once the current one has ended.

# Development Environment

This program was made using Visual Studio Community. Having access to the debugger
was one of the important tools to help locate any errors I may have initially missed.

This is a C++ language program, using 4 primary libraries: iostream, string, vector, and set.
Each of these contributed to their necessary spots and made this program much easier to make.

# Future Work


- Better Error Handling
	Error Handling has been done at a more basic level to ensure that the words
	and guesses are done properly. Better error handling would help to more efficiently
	handle these errors, as well as any other bugs that may come up.
- Efficiency
    While the program works, the biggest potential concern with this program is efficiency.
	This could potentially include utilizing libraries more to make better use of them or finding
	ways to cut some of the loops in the program with more efficient options.
- Future content
    Overtime, I would like to find a way to set up a picture of the hangman like students
	would with a whiteboard. On top of that, there could even be an option to add
	numbers into the game, to make it more challenging for users.
